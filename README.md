PSUI
====
Themed CSS-styles for HTML-widgets (`<input>`-elements with types `text`, `radio`, `checkbox`, `range`, `file`).

These are done (almost) purely with HTML and CSS. Only place where a little bit of inline Javascript is used
is the updating of output of ranges and synchronizing range and number.

See the [Demo page](http://pesasa.github.io/psui).

This is done as an experiment on what kind of styling and functionality can be done
with HTML and CSS with as little Javascript as possible.
